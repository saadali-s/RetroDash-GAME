# Retrodash-game
Compilation of c# code required to make a typical endless-runner in unity.
I made the game retrodash and published it to the playstore .
This project is a display of what could be used in order to make such a game,
although ideas may differ, the format for such games is generally the same,
game developers can copy and apply it to their own game!
