# Retrodash-game
Compilation of c# code required to make a typical endless-runner in unity
i made an endless runner published on the playstore called retrodash
it is an endless runner
This project is a display of what could be used in order to make such a game
although ideas may differ, the format for such games in generally the same
game developers can copy and apply it to their own game!
